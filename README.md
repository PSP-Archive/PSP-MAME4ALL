PSP MAME4ALL is port created by TTYman, and based on the MAME GP2x emulator developed by Franxis. MAME GP2x saw its last release (version 5.1) in November 2007. The same developer would later start the 'MAME4ALL for GP2X' project - which supported a wider romset, and had its last release in March 2010 (version 2.5). This PSP port, despite its name, is unrelated to this later project.
