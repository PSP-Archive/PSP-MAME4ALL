# PSP MAME4ALL
PSP MAME4ALL is port created by TTYman, and based on the MAME GP2x emulator developed by Franxis. 

MAME GP2x saw its last release (version 5.1) in November 2007. The same developer would later start the 'MAME4ALL for GP2X' project - which supported a wider romset, and had its last release in March 2010 (version 2.5). This PSP port, despite its name, is unrelated to this later project.

The compatibility list for the GP2X version (on which this port is based on) can be found here:

## Supported games

There are 1204 different supported romsets. For more details, see "gamelist.txt" file within the release. Games have to be copied into the /roms/ folder.

### ROM names

Folder names or ZIP file names are listed on "gamelist.txt" file.
Romsets have to be MAME 0.34 final version ones (December 1998), but there are also some new added romsets from later MAME versions, as well as modified romsets.

Please use "clrmame_roms.dat" file to convert romsets from other MAME versions to the ones used by this version for GP2X, using ClrMAME Pro utility.

NOTE: File and directory names in Linux are case-sensitive. Put all file and directory names using low case!.
